Hi,

I created University Database these under rules and constraints;

An e-learning university needs to keep details of its students and staff, the courses that
it offers and the performance of the students who study its courses. The university is
administered in four geographical regions (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland).


Information about each student should be initially recorded at registration. This includes
the studentâ€™s identification number issued at the time, name, year of registration and the
region in which the student is located. A student is not required to enroll in any courses
at registration; enrollment in a course can happen at a later time.


Information recorded for each member of the tutorial and counseling staff must include
the staff number, name and region in which he or she is located. Each staff member
may act as a counselor to one or more students, and may act as a tutor to one or more
students on one or more courses. It may be the case that, at any particular point in time,
a member of staff may not be allocated any students to tutor or counsel.


Each student has one counselor, allocated at registration, who supports the student
throughout his or her university career. A student is allocated a separate tutor for each
course in which he or she is enrolled. A staff member may only counsel or tutor a
student who is resident in the same region as that staff member.

  
Each course that is available for study must have a course code, a title and a value in
terms of credit points. A course is either a 15-point course or a 30-point course. A
course may have a quota for the number of students enrolled in it at any one
presentation. A course need not have any students enrolled in it (such as a course that
has just been written and offered for study).

 
Students are constrained in the number of courses they can be enrolled in at any one
time. They may not take courses simultaneously if their combined points total exceeds
180 points.


For assessment purposes, a 15-point course may have up to three assignments per
presentation and a 30-point course may have up to five assignments per presentation.
The grade for an assignment on any course is recorded as a mark out of 100.
